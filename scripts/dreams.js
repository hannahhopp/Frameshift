    dreamType: STANDARD,
    dream: `Zombie apocalypse. I start out at mom's house. I see zombies outside and they're trying to get in. I board up the windows and doors, but they keep breaking in. I run away to a safe camp. I'm relieved, but it doesn't last long. A zombie breaks in and soon all hell is breaking loose. I fade in and out of lucidity as I fly away Child of Light style.\n

    I go back to mom's house, where I remember that I didn't feed a dog I was supposed to be taking care of. Hiya or Bandit had been locked in the garage for five days. I wonder how he survived. I'm scared of opening doors to get to the dog because I don't know if he's been infected.\n

    I see zombies outside. A toddler zombie Grace is trying to break in. I push against the door, but I can't keep them out. One of the zombies is sentient. He is a boy, he says he won't harm us. We trust him.`

    title: 'River rocks in my sink',
    dreamType: LUCID,
    dream: `I am walking on a path leading out of this old backyard. It looked very Arizona, with dirt everywhere, desert shrubbery. It is dark. I realize I am dreaming, and everything snaps into focus. I try not to get too excited and keep walking. It is hard to keep my pace even, because I want to speed up and figure out where this path is going. There are people standing or sitting around the path. I nod to them and keep walking. The details start to fade even though I try to hold onto them. I focus on walking. My vision goes black, but I can still hear my footsteps. I start to run, thinking the energy will bring me back. Then, with a huge force of will, I shout, “CLARITY NOW,” and launch myself off the ground. Everything comes back into focus and I am so happy and excited. I do loop-de-loops, swinging around trees. I let myself fall down to this lake far, far below me and then fly up just before hitting the water. I can feel gravity's effect on my gut and it is awesome.\n

    Then, I'm in my apartment. It is a crappy hotel room. I am throwing a party. But, something goes wrong, and my kitchen sink overflows and floods. Everyone leaves. I reach into the drain and pull out river rock and beautiful gems. All the rocks have brilliant color and are amazingly smooth. There are tons of rocks in my drain. I am still scooping them out when the plumber guy comes. After that, I go to sit on my bed while he does his work. While I am sitting, a voice starts talking to me in my head. It is a quiet, almost robotic voice. It says, “Listen to me. Every time I try to talk to you, you get afraid and shut me out. So I'm reaching out directly to you...” It keeps going. Even though I try to listen, it fades into the background as a low mumble. I can't tell if I am afraid, or maybe this is why I have such a hard time getting lucid.\n

    The next thing I know, Molly is next to my bed, looking at me. I am shocked to see her, but I don't let it show. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction. I look at her briefly and speak to the plumber instead. She won't go away, though. She sits at the foot of my bed and keeps looking at me with this happy, expectant expression on her face like she's doing me a solid by acknowledging me. This just pisses me off, so when I do talk to her, I'm terse and just want her to go away because my life is better now.`

    title: 'The land before time',
    dreamType: STANDARD,
    dream: `I am Little Foot from The Land Before Time. Humans have traveled through time and set up a village where I live. I watch them live. I see a pen where downtrodden dogs are kept. They are dirty and walk with a slouch, making themselves as small as possible as if they were afraid. I want a pet, so the humans let me inside the pen to see what they have. I walk by some stairs where there are bunnies. One of them leaps out and rubs up against me like a cat. I knew then that I had to have it.\n

    I play Frisbee on the beach.`

    title: 'Cabin in the eye of the storm',
    dreamType: LUCID,
    dream: `Kelly and I go back to sleep for an extra 90 minutes. As I'm falling asleep, I start “falling”. I realize that I'm falling asleep, so I start focusing on what it feels like to be dreaming. I relax my eyes like I'm looking at a magic 3D poster, and I think about how I physically feel while dreaming...\n
    Then, I'm dreaming.\n

    I'm in a grocery store, lucid and walking around. The dream fades in and out of focus, so I repeat to myself, “I am aware and in control of my dream,” and, “Clarity, now.” Affirmations work best for me when I'm stabilizing a dream.\n

    Once the dream is stable, I walk out of the store because I'm bored of it. In the parking lot, people are walking back to their cars. I remember that one of the things I wanted to do in a LD was speak to a dream character. I run up to an old white woman with grey hair who looks a bit like that Aunt Martha/Judy or something comic strip.\n

    I ask her, “Who are you and why are you in my dream?”\n

    She looks at me and says, “Aaskjhiwufsd?” It's muffled.\n

    I reply, “What?”\n

    She repeats her gibberish.\n

    I walk away from her and run up to an old man and ask, “Who are you and why are you in my dream?”\n

    His response is also in gibberish. I am disappointed. I think of the next thing I wanted to do in a LD.\n

    I want to look at myself sleeping. So, I start running and flying toward a small blue house in the distance. I fly in through the window.. and then, I wake up. I roll over and look at Kelly, saying, “I just had the most amazing dream!”\n

    She doesn't respond, only smiles. I smile too and stroke her face, gazing into her eyes. I suddenly realize, I'M STILL DREAMING...\n

    I roll back over and return to sleep, reappearing in the parking lot. This time, Kelly is with me. I hold her hand and remember the dream cabin we created, and I want to go there. I start looking for the elevator that we said would take us out of any dream and to the cabin.\n

    When we turn around the corner of the lot, I see a white metal door with a silver handle on the wall. I know that this is the elevator. I open the door, which is heavy, and we walk inside. The inside has white tile with mirrors for walls. I push the button for the cabin, and the elevator starts descending.
    It goes down for a long time. It takes such a long time, I worry that I will wake up.\n

    Then, we arrive.\n

    When Kelly and I designed the cabin, the elevator opened up into the cabin. The cabin itself resided on a tiny island (like Master Roshi's from DBZ). This dream cabin was nothing like this...\n
    When we step out, it is onto a beach with a roaring storm all around it. It is like we are in the eye of a hurricane. The clouds are dark grey, brown, and billowy, like monsoon clouds mixed with sublimating dry ice. There is lightning, thunder, rain. It is beautiful.\n

    I turn around and walk into the cabin. It is dreary but peaceful. Everything is made of wood. I see River at the piano. I go to him and squat down next to him to hug him because he is so cute. I wonder inwardly if I am dreaming of him because he has replaced Griffin as the cute little baby person in my life.\n

    When I look to the other side of the room, I see Becky sitting a high chair with a blue baby onesie, a bonnet, and a pacifier. It is the image of hilarity. I wonder if this is what I really think of her.\n

    I turn again, and see Griffin. He is as tall as a teenager and looking down at me. He's so big! I don't want him to grow up.\n
    Kelly and I go to a window to watch the storm for a little while. When I look down, there is a massive parking lot. I wonder, 'Is this really our island?' I thought it was supposed to be private. To remedy this, I walk to a door and tell myself that when I walk through this door, I will really be in our cabin. However, when I walk through, it's just another room of the same cabin. I look outside the window of this room and see patches of blue sky to the left of the storm we were looking at in the other room. The recognition of space in a dream impresses me.\n

    I decide that I am bored of the cabin and go outside. I run, and then I fly. While I am flying I look around. I am fading in and out of focus, and then remember one more thing that I wanted to do in a LD: meditate.\n

    I don't have enough control of the dream to stop flying, so instead I start to meditate as I fly. I focus on my breathing. Each deep inhale causes the dream to become more realistic. It is so real, it's hard to believe that it isn't. I see a road that comes out of the ocean. A car drives from under the water, up the road, with no struggle.\n

    I don't know where my mind comes up with this stuff, but I feel joy. I'm smiling and the dream fades out of focus and my alarm goes off.`

    title: 'The outcasts',
    dreamType: STANDARD,
    dream: `I’m sleeping in my room and suddenly someone knocks on my door. She’s a cleaning woman, she tells me she’s cleaned all my dishes. I’m so out of it and sleep paralyzed that I can’t respond well. I ask her who she is and struggle to get out of bed. Everything feels like molasses. I move blearily downstairs, which is mom’s house. There’s a lot of commotion. The cleaning lady is vacuuming the guest room. I ask mom what’s going on, and get sucked into a drama of the social outcasts welcoming me into their group. The first two are named Gabe and Hop, a midget and an overweight boy with Downs. Both tell me my skateboarding isn’t very good, which I agree with. I hold my small skateboard in my hand, it’s beat up and snapped in half. I keep sticking it back together and skating anyway and falling and hurting myself.`

    title: 'The day I knew I could leave',
    dreamType: LUCID,
    dream: `I was laying in bed, trying to fall back to sleep. when I remembered to WILD. I said, "I'm Dreaming." My body started to get heavy, like someone was pushing on my chest. I knew this was normal, I told myself it would be OK. The heaviness came and went. I started to think about astral projection. I imagined my body floating up off the bed. After a few heaviness feelings, my body started to rise. I floated up toward the ceiling. I started losing control and floated back down to the bed. This repeated a few times. I floated up... then down, down, down, past the bed. Then, I could control it. I flew out of my apartment, out the front door, which was open. I saw my neighbors - one of their doors was open. I floated up, then started flying toward the ocean.\n

    When I got there, I flew around. I wondered if David could see me. I felt so proud of myself. Then, a German Shepard appeared, and I became afraid. It chased me into the water. Underwater, I remembered that it was a dream. I faced the dog, put my arm out. It bit my arm, hard. I could feel the pain, but I knew it couldn't hurt me. It bit me again, then I shooed it away.\n

    I flew up. I looked to the sky, and wanted to go to space, but figured I would lose control of the dream, so I flew into the city. I flew until, looking up, I saw two towers of a castle sticking out above the clouds, and I knew I wanted to go there. It was a church. Cruella Deville was there.\n

    I had to repel missiles being shot at me as I flew closer to the building. I did this by waving my hand, causing the missiles to bounce back toward their cannons. I got tired of this after a few times, then I crossed my arms and flung them out - all of the cannons exploded down the path. I got to the castle.\n

    Cruella showed me around. I didn't like walking, because I would lose lucidity, but it was too small a space to fly.\n

    I walked over, and found Zaq playing on a piano that carved deeply into his leg. It was so disturbing. I told him to stop, then I pulled over another piano. When I played, I could see the notes acting like projectiles on a screen that had a game like Galaga.\n

    I woke up, and I was in my apartment with Justin and Zaq. I excitedly told them I'd just had a lucid dream. Zaq puts on the TV and 100 Dalmations starts playing. I tell him Cruella was in my dream.\n

    I lay back down, and start astral projecting again. I'm flying over a beautiful landscape - forests, mountains. Justin asks me what I'm doing, and I say I'm lucid dreaming again... then, I get even more excited because I'm dreaming and telling him I'm dreaming at the same time.\n

    Then, I'm at a cello school. It's set in a Banjo Kazooie world. It's its own little city - kind of like a university. I go to one of the buildings, thinking it's the dorm, but it's not. It's the local convenience store. There's this girl who I sit next to, and I find out she's my roommate. I ask her where the dorm is. She doesn't know either. We walk around. There's another building - has guys in it... being guys. I think we leave. We find a place that is displaying a gallery of all the cellos the students have brought. There's one that's shaped like a bass and looks like a skull. The girl is fascinated by it... I just think it's dumb.`

    title: 'Growing a garden in Hell',
    dreamType: VIVID,
    dream: `I go to Kate's and have dinner with her and Ben. Fish and rice tacos. They are fantastic. I stay the night. In the morning, Ben has more food made. I don't know if there is some for me, and I don't want to ask. When Ben goes to the bathroom, I grab one. I eat sneakily. He goes to the stove and looks at what is left. I ask if I'd grabbed something I shouldn't have. He says yes, but that it is okay. I go to wake Kate up, because we need to go to work. I feel like a bad roommate for eating their food. I tell them I will make them dinner that night. I will make what I feel is my signature dish - tilapia with balsamic butter, salad, and rice. We get into the car to head to work. I get out of the car at the market to buy some fish. The market is strange, though. I order two fillets of fish and have to follow them on a conveyor belt. The conveyor belt leads to Hell.\n

    I wake up as part of a crowd in a large, domed room. There are lots of people groaning and mumbling. I feel very muddled, and movement feels blurry. I try to piece together where I am. I realize I have followed my food into Hell. Maybe I'm dead, I don't know. I pull myself out of my confines - I think I'm part of the wall. Once I'm out, I try to find anyone that I know. Everyone seems to not know where they are. They just stand there in a daze. I find Abraham first. He doesn't recognize me. I shake his shoulder and speak to him until some light appears in his eyes. He asks me what I'm doing here, although he isn't sure where here is. I look around and find that there are lines on the ground. I figure they have to lead somewhere. I tell him to follow me, I'll get us out of here.\n

    As we follow the lines, I try to wake other people up to bring them with us. Even after some people wake up, after they follow me for a while, they forget what they are doing and wander away. Even Abraham does this. He keeps saying he wants to find Mom - she is here, somewhere. I chase him down a couple of times to bring him back with me. We follow the lines. Eventually, we make it to the end of the level, and wake up in the next.\n

    It's another large, domed room. The people in this room are a bit more active. They have roles to play, although none of them realize where they are or what they're doing things for. People speak to each other. It feels like a very large play. As in the first level, everything felt filthy. The people are dirty, and there are no signs of plants, water, nor buildings anywhere. Just people moving about in dirty rags. In the last level, I'd gotten the group to focus long enough to work on this puzzle. It was a large board with lines and knobs. The board was a map of the area we were in. If we slid the knobs to all of the O's drawn on the map, we would solve the puzzle and I think get out of there. But, solving it just sent us to this level.\n

    Abraham, an old man, and I wander to the food court of this level. There is a setup where they are serving this green sludge that comes from a giant iron bucket.\n

    I speak to the server, ask her how long she'd been working here.\n

    She says she just signed a contract for 42.\n

    I ask, "42?"\n

    She responds, "Oh no, much longer than that. I signed a contract for 420 years. It's a great deal." I am horrified.\n

    I look around some more and note that at the top of the dome, there are giant holes in the wall with lines coming out of them. I instantly know that we have to get on the boats I'd seen on the map of the first level to follow these lines. But, I don't know how to get back.\n

    Instead, I find a spot of land by the food court and convince some of my followers to start a garden. The land is unforgiving, and our first crops are slimy and gross. The authorities who run the food court come and destroy our garden while we watch. Instead of getting discouraged, we move to a hill and start over. Our previous garden had awoken some other people, and so we have more help. The garden is more than twice as big. I smile and speak with the old man who had followed me the longest.\n

    I say, "Even destruction is sometimes a blessing in disguise."\n

    These new plants still look sickly, but they are giving an energy to the area that had not been there before. Some of the people in the area, though still dazed, stand to watch us grow.`
